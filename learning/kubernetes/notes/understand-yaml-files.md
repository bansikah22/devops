## Overview of 
- The 3 parts of configuration file
- Connecting Deployments to Service to Pods
- Demo file

### The 3 parts of configuration file
- metadata 
- specification

- The first part of the configuration file(metadata)
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
```
Shows what we want to create while in the specification
- The second part of the configuration file
```yaml 
metadata:
  name: my-app
  labels:
    app: my-app
```
Attributes of "spec" are `specific` to the `kind`

- The third part of the configuration file (status) is automatically added or generated by kubernetes
```yaml 
spec:
  replicas: ...
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ...
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ...
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ...
        image: ...
```
making sure that the desired = actual state
The status each kubernetes component is been stored or held by the `etcd`

### YAML configuration files
- YAML files are human-readable text files
- They are used to describe Kubernetes objects
- They are written in a format that is easy for humans to read and write
- They are typically named with a `.yaml` or `.yml` extension
- Strict on indentation, use yaml validator

### Blue print for pods
**Layers of Abstraction
- Deployment manages a ..
- ReplicaSet manages a set of Pods
- Pod is a single instance of a container
- Service exposes Pods to the outside world
- Each contained insided the other as templates, which contains metadata

### Connecting components (Labes & Selectors & Ports) 
- Labels are key-value pairs that can be attached to Kubernetes objects
- Labels are used to select Pods for deployment
- Labels are defined in the metadata section of the YAML configuration file
- Labels can be used to group Pods
- Labels can be used to select Pods for Services
- `metadata` contains `labels` and `spec` contains `selectors`

- Pods get the labels through the template blueprint
- This label is matched by the selector

- Service contains a selector that matches the labels of the pod
- service has its ports configuration

### ports in service and pod
```yaml
# service in pods
selector:
  app: my-app

ports:
 - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80  
```
The `port` in the service and `targetPort` in the pod are the same. The `port` in the service is the port that the service will expose, while the `target
```yaml
# pod in pods
containers:
  - name: my-app
    image: my-app:1.0
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```
