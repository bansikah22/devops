## Directory and File Descriptions

- **docs/**: This directory contains documentation files that explain the project structure and usage.

- **inventory/**: This directory contains inventory files that define the hosts and groups of hosts for different environments (staging and production).

- **playbooks/**: This directory contains playbooks that define the tasks to be executed on the hosts. Each playbook is focused on a specific area of management, such as file handling, package management, and service management.

- **roles/**: This directory contains roles that encapsulate reusable tasks and handlers. The `common` role includes tasks and handlers that can be reused across different playbooks.

- **ansible.cfg**: This configuration file sets default values for Ansible, including the location of the inventory files.

## Conclusion

This project structure is designed to facilitate the management of configurations and deployments across different environments using Ansible. Each component is organized to promote clarity and reusability, making it easier to maintain and extend the setup as needed.
