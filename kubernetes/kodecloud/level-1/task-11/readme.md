A junior DevOps team member encountered difficulties deploying a stack on the Kubernetes cluster. The pod fails to start, presenting errors. Let's troubleshoot and rectify the issue promptly.


There is a pod named webserver, and the container within it is named nginx-container, its utilizing the nginx:latest image.

Additionally, there's a sidecar container named sidecar-container using the ubuntu:latest image.

Identify and address the issue to ensure the pod is in the running state and the application is accessible.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.

### Solution
```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod webserver
kubectl delete pod webserver
kubectl apply -f webserver.yaml
##Verify pod status
kubectl get pods 
```
