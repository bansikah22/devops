## Tool-Specific Guidelines

### Jenkins
- Place Jenkins pipelines and scripts in the `jenkins/` directory.
- Ensure you test pipeline updates with `Jenkinsfile` Linter before submission.

### Kubernetes
- Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) go under `kubernetes/`.
- Add comments in manifests for clarity, especially for configurations like resource limits and security contexts.
- Use Helm for reusable charts and place them in `helm/`.

### Linux
- Linux shell scripts should be placed in `linux/scripts/` and must be executable (`chmod +x`).
- Follow the [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) guidelines to ensure script quality.

### AWS & Azure
- AWS CloudFormation templates should be in `aws/cloudformation/`.
- Azure ARM templates and Bicep scripts go under `azure/arm-templates/` and `azure/bicep/`.

### Ansible
- Ansible playbooks should reside in `ansible/playbooks/`.
- Test all playbooks using `ansible-lint` before submitting.
